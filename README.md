## Project Overview
This is the personal portfolio website of **Deniz Pandar**, a Junior Full Stack Developer. The main purpose of this project is to provide a **professional online presence** that showcases Deniz’s skills, experiences, and projects in a structured and visually appealing manner.

This portfolio website was built to present web development projects in a **clean, interactive, and accessible way**. Rather than a static list of works, each project is displayed with a live preview and clear context — highlighting the technologies used, the problems addressed, and the role Deniz played in building them.
