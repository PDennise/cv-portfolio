## Project Overview
This is the personal portfolio website of **Deniz Pandar**, a Junior Full Stack Developer. The main purpose of this project is to provide a **professional online presence** that showcases Deniz’s skills, experiences, and projects in a structured and visually appealing manner.

This portfolio website was built to present web development projects in a **clean, interactive, and accessible way**. Rather than a static list of works, each project is displayed with a live preview and clear context — highlighting the technologies used, the problems addressed, and the role Deniz played in building them. The design emphasizes **usability and user experience** while maintaining a **minimal aesthetic**, allowing the projects themselves to take center stage.

## Project Rationale  

This portfolio was created to **introduce myself as a Junior Full Stack Developer** and demonstrate my technical and design skills in a professional format. It reflects a balance between creativity and functionality, showing not only coding proficiency but also an understanding of layout, typography, and responsive design principles.  

### Key Project Goals  
- Provide a **well-organized and visually appealing portfolio**  
- Showcase **front-end development skills**, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design  
- Allow potential employers, collaborators, or other developers to **explore projects easily**  

### Target Audience  
- **Employers and recruiters** looking to evaluate web development skills  
- **Fellow developers or collaborators** interested in projects or partnerships  
- **Anyone seeking inspiration or examples of clean, responsive portfolio design**

## Website Structure
The website is divided into several sections for clarity and easy navigation:

#### Navbar
The navigation bar is located at the top of the website and allows users to quickly move to different sections such as Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact.
The active link is highlighted with an underline effect, so users always know which section they are viewing.
On smaller screens, the navigation menu adapts to a mobile-friendly layout.
